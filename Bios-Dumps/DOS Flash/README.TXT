
DOS Flash Utility
=================

DOSFlash.exe - Use locally or with a Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) 
               management application (e.g. Altiris eXpress) to update or
               restore the System BIOS. 


NOTE:  A BIOS update may be done using these utilities from a USB hard drive
or a USB flash media device.  Copy all the files in this folder to a DOS 
bootable medium.  Make sure that the device you want to boot from is connected
to the computer to be upgraded and power cycle the computer.  When the system 
boots to the USB device, the BIOS update may then be performed.  
See DOSFlash.txt for syntax.

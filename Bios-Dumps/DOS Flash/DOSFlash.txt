      =========================================================

                  DOSFLASH.EXE  version 1.15.01       

      =========================================================
 

The DOS Flash utility is designed to update the computer system firmware
(BIOS) from a DOS, FreeDOS, or similar environment. Windows command line
is not supported.

The DOS Flash utility consists of the executable file (DOSFlash.exe) and a 
driver file (FlshUefi.cpu) specific to updating the system BIOS. They must be
present in the same directory. DOS Flash also supports updating the initial 
graphics display logo to a custom image.



BIOS VERSION UPDATE:
____________________

DOS Flash requires a BIOS binary image file included in a BIOS SoftPaq 
release in order to update the System BIOS.  See the DOS Flash folder for the
correct files.  Not all HP Desktop systems are compatible with this version of
the DOS Flash utility.  If the utility is run on a system that does not 
support it, an error message will say so.  The BIOS SoftPaq release package 
for that system will include the correct DOS Flash tool (typically, 
Flashbin.exe and flsh.cpu).

DOS Flash can update a system BIOS without requiring the administrator to 
enter a Setup password if the unit has not already been assigned a Setup 
password.  However if a Setup password is set on the target PC, then DOS Flash
will require password verification before allowing a BIOS update, or the 
process will report an error. The Setup password must be provided in the 
command line when the DOS Flash utility is executed, using the /p option. 
See below for syntax description. 



CUSTOM LOGO IMAGE UPDATE:
_________________________

DOS Flash allows replacing the standard HP logo image with a custom image 
provided by the user. Valid image files are JPEG or uncompressed BMP (bitmap)
images up to 1024 x 768 resolution.  Also, the maximum file size differs from
system to system, but will be between 22KB and 32KB.  The command line switch 
"/I " followed by the image filename will write the custom logo to the BIOS. 
When using DOS Flash to change the logo, the System BIOS is not updated at the
same time.  The custom image can be deleted (restoring the standard HP logo) 
with the "/I delete" option.



COMMAND LINE SYNTAX:
____________________


UPDATE SYSTEM BIOS:


  dosflash [/p <password>] [/f flshuefi.cpu <BIOS family>]


DOS Flash will search the current directory for the System BIOS binary. If
more than one are present, the latest BIOS image file (highest version number) 
compatible with the target PC will be used.

The /f option is used when needing to suppress any user prompts, for instance
when automating a mass deployment using Altiris. BIOS family is listed in BIOS
Setup / System Information / System BIOS before the version number (e.g. L01),
and is also the first part of the binary filename.


UPDATE STARTUP IMAGE:


  dosflash /I {<imagefile> | delete} 


If the imagefile file size exceeds the maximum for the target PC, a File Too
Large error is reported, along with the maximum file size supported for the
system.



USE CASES:
__________


dosflash
   This will attempt to update the System BIOS. Assumes no BIOS Setup password
      is set.


dosflash /p Admin123  
   This will attempt to update the System BIOS using “Admin123” as the BIOS
      Setup password for authentication.


dosflash /p Admin123 /I hplogo.jpg  
   This will update the system startup logo using “hplogo.jpg” as the image,
      and uses “Admin123” to authenticate the BIOS Setup password.


dosflash /Image custom.jpg
   This will update the system startup logo using “custom.jpg” as the image.
      This syntax implies that there is no BIOS Setup password set.


dosflash /I delete
   This will delete a custom startup logo from the system. The default HP logo
      will be used after reboot. This syntax implies that there is no BIOS
      Setup password set.


dosflash /I DELETE /P Admin123
   This will delete a custom startup logo from the system. The default HP logo
      will be used after reboot. Uses “Admin123” as the BIOS Setup password
      for authentication.


dosflash /f flshuefi.cpu L01
   This will update the System BIOS with the binary in the current directory 
      without pausing for user input. 


dosflash /I custom.jpg /p Admin123 /f flshuefi.cpu L01
   This will update the system startup logo using "custom.jpg" as the image, 
      authenticating with a BIOS Setup password of "Admin123" and suppressing
      prompts.



ERROR LEVELS:
_____________

0  - No errors

4  - Could not open input file

16 - Unsupported system type

44 - Could not open flshuefi.cpu

45 - All other errors:  wrong password, file size too big, image dimensions 
     too large


CHANGE HISTORY:
_______________

Version 1.15.01
- Fixed slow DOSFLASH response with certain USB Drives

Version 1.15.00
- Added Support for new ROM Families (i.e. K01)
